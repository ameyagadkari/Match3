    Instructions: Welcome to the WayForward Unity Programmer Test.  This test
    consists of 3 parts.  
    
    First, Answer the questions in the AnswerMe region

    Second, follow the instructions in the ImplementTheseFunctions
    region below. 
    
    Third, Implement a simple Match 3 using Unity UI (Canvas based UI).
    The Match3 should function in 16:9 portrait mode (so 9:16)
    Match 3 features requires:
        * 5 different tile types - Starting point prefabs provided in Prefab folder, modify as necessary
        * A 9x9 grid that gets randomly populated with the tiles
        * The Ability for the player to touch a tile and swap it with an adjacent tile
        * The Functionality to detect matches
            * 3 or more tiles of the same type adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically)
            * Matches that overlap (such as a T shape) should count as a single match (of 5 tiles)
        * Giving points based on matches
        * Removing matched tiles
        * Moving tiles down to fill empty spots
        * Randomly spawning tiles at the top row to fill empty spots there
    A very limited start has been provided in the Match3 scene, TODO comments have been left in
    Grid.cs to help you get started.
